The motor mounts are 3D printed using PLA material with 50% infill for durability. CAD models for the mounts are available in the [/docs/stl](/docs/stl/) directory.

## Control Architecture

The AK60 actuators connect to the Intel NUC through a CAN bus interface,~~we use a modified version of the [WiCAN Hardware](https://github.com/mittechteam/wican-fw)~~ we use the [USB2CAN Module](https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/latest/hardware/usb-can-datasheet.html) from ODrive. The system uses ROS2 nodes to:
1. Read encoder data from motors
2. Calculate odometry
3. Send velocity commands to individual wheels
