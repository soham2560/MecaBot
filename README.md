## Development Setup
- To pull latest docker image
    ```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/soham2560/humble-garden:latest
    ```
- To start container
    - Open Command Pallete with `Ctrl+Shift+P`
    - Select Option to Rebuild and Reopen Container

  #### Note: To prevent unintentional cross machine communication on the same network, be sure to set the [ROS_DOMAIN_ID](/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json#L70) to a number(between 0-100) different that the other machine

  ### Action Buttons
  We use the [VSCode Action Button Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=seunlanlege.action-buttons) to facilitate development. They are not necessary but certainly do help. To access these buttons you may need to enable it through the Extensions Tab in VSCode, though the extension should download automatically on container startup. The available buttons are as follows:
  - `Build`

    Builds the workspace packages upto `robot_bringup`

    ```bash
    colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to robot_bringup
    ```

  - `Import Libs`

    Uses [vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool) to import the repositories listed in [dep.repos](dep.repos)

    ```bash
    rm -rf /ros2_ws/src/dep_repos && mkdir -p /ros2_ws/src/dep_repos && vcs import /ros2_ws/src/dep_repos < /ros2_ws/src/dep.repos
    ```

  Note: Remember to use `Import Libs` on every fresh container startup (not necessary on reopen)

## Hardware Setup
  Information about the Hardware Setup can be found [here](/docs/hardware.md)

## How to Use
- **Build and Source the workspace**

  It is suggested to use the [Action Buttons](#action-buttons) to build, but if you're unable due to some reason, you can use the commands below

  ```bash
  colcon build --symlink-install --packages-up-to robot_bringup
  source install/setup.bash
  ```

  Note: Ensure you've run `Import Libs` atleast once (or the equivalent command)
- WiCAN Setup (⚠️ **_Deprecated_**: Look at USB2CAN below)
    ```bash
    sudo slcand -o -s8 -t sw -S 3000000 /dev/ttyUSB0 can0
    sudo ifconfig can0 txqueuelen 1000
    sudo ifconfig can0 up
    ```
    Note: You need to change `ttyUSB0` to the WiCAN device
- **To setup USB2CAN** (only if working on hardware)

    NOTE: This is to be on **host** (NOT in container), it is a one time process and won't have to be repeated again
    ```bash
    cd scripts
    chmod +x usb2can_udev.sh
    ./usb2can_udev.sh
    ```
- **Launch**

  ```bash
  ros2 launch robot_bringup robot_bringup.launch.py use_rviz:=True use_sim_time:=False
  ```
  Available arguments are as follows:

  | Argument      | Default Value | Description                                    |
  |--------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
  | `use_sim_time` | `False`      | Launch in simulation mode (`True` for simulation, `False` for hardware connection). |
  | `namespace`   | `""` (empty)  | Namespace for the launched nodes.              |
  | `record`      | `False`      | Enable recording to a rosbag.                  |
  | `use_rviz`    | `False`      | Launch RViz on startup.                        |

- **Interact**

  To interact with the drive, you can use the `teleop_twist_keyboard` node by launching it as follows
  ```bash
  ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
  ```
